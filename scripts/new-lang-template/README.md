# $LANG_NAME

Add a short summary about the language, including link(s) to the language specification and sample programs.

## Notes for the user

- Add details and quirks (if any) about the Esolang Park implementation of this esolang.
- These are details that the user may want to know while executing or debugging programs on the editor.

## Implementation details

- Add notes that a contributor may want to read while looking at the source code of the language provider.
- This includes any third-party libraries you've used, something you've done for performance, or just the
  main decisions you took while implementing the language provider.
- If the source code is simple enough, you can simply omit this section.

## Possible improvements

- Add any bugs or suboptimalities in the language provider that a contributor can work on.
- (this section doesn't mean you can add a half-baked interpreter and leave, though.)
